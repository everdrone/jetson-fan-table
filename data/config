; Sets the update interval (in seconds) at which the program reads
; from the temperature sensors.
; To perform less read operations set this to a higher value.
interval = 2

; Ignores temperatures measured from sensors containing this string
; in their names. The PMIC sensor is ignored by default.
; If PMIC is not ignored the average temperature will be higher and the
; maximum temperature will be 100 C, pushing the fan to it's maximum
; speed at all times.
ignore_sensors = PMIC

; Enables the fan tachometer for real time RPM measurements.
; This does not affect the speed of the fan or how the program operates
; When enabled, the RPM speed is printed with `fantable --status`.
# enable_tach = yes

; If set to `no` the temperature is measured using an the highest
; measured temperature instead of computing the average of all sensors.
average = no

; Tells the program to call jetson_clocks to set the GPU and CPU clocks
; to the maximum operating frequency available.
# max_freq = no
